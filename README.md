## Viz 1: Bubbles of "District Success" 

The first bubble chart encodes success data in the area of the circles. This
sucess data is based on the average percentage pass (percentage pass is the percentage of students who pass exams in a certain school). Although less perceptually-accurate than bar charts, they can pack hundreds of values into a small space.

## Viz 2: Mapping Classroom Needs During a Population Boom

The three maps allow us to compare the staff needs of schools over the next 35
years. We used population.io data for the next 8 years, and conservative UN
projections to 2040. Using current student to teacher ratios, we project how
many more teachers will need to be hired in the coming decades. By 2040, the
number of teaching will need to double just to maintain the current ratio.
